# Elanco Animal Health Dashboard

This project was developed in collaboration with **Elanco**, an international company dedicated to preventing and treating illness in farm animals and pets. The aim of the project was to create a **web-based dashboard** that enables pet owners and administrators to **visualise animal health data, identify trends, and receive alerts for irregularities**.

The system was implemented using **PHP, SQLite, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a strong focus on clarity of presentation and accessibility.
